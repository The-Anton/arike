"Arike" is a Malayalam word that roughly translates to "Alongside" or "Besides" in English. The project caters to a system of specialized medical staff tending to patients under palliative care.

In India, palliative care is provided by a specially trained team of nurses who visit the patients under their Panchayat/Municipality/Corporation directly to relieve their suffering and give them and their families the best possible quality of life. At present, many states have their own palliative care systems in place.

The treatment under palliative care is an extremely complex process, and it's mostly paperbound, which makes it inefficient and error bound. Our capstone project is to build a system that makes the process more efficient and automated.
